#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development , testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Software engineering plays an essential role in the tech industry by facilitating the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

The examples of software engineering projects include the development of operating systems, Web and mobile apps, and embedded systems.



2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Answer: The key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:

a.	Development of programming languages including Fortran and C

b.	The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

c.	The advent of structured programming in the 1970s 

d.	The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer: Software Development Life Cycle

a.	Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

b.	Design: Creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.

c.	Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

d.	Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

e.	Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.

f.	Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.


4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: Waterfall methodology embraces a sequential approach through the Software Development Life Cycle initiating the development process with the requirements phase followed by design and then the eventual implementation. On the other hand, the agile methodologies embrace an iteration of the phases and thus embraces an incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, collaboration and adaptability to change.

Therefore, the Waterfall methodology would be most appropriate for industries such as healthcare or finance where extensive documentation and well-defined flow of processes is required. On the other hand, the agile methodology is most appropriate in scenarios including software and game development start-ups where the user requirements keep changing hence the need for flexibility and iterations in the development cycle.


5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio, Eclipse and Intellij IDEA

Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. E.g Git and Subversion 



7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer: Some of the common challenges faced by software engineers include changing requirements during the project cycle leading to scope creep, compromise in quality of the software products due to tight deadlines that lead to immense pressure and the consequent rushed development. I addition, technical debt also poses a challenge as it results from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions and hence can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

The strategies for overcoming these challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritisation of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.



8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer: Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software 

Integration testing: Testing interactions between different software components or subsystems

System testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.

The importance of the different types of testing in quality assurance is enabling the identification and fixing of defects in the development process leading to higher quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer: Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models is ensuring the models understand what is required of them by a user. This is facilitated by crafting of clear and specific questions and statements to enable desired output by an AI tool. Being concise, provision of context and the use of keywords in the prompt help in fine-tuning the desired output.



2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer: Vague Prompt: Who was the first president?

Refined Prompt: Who was the first black president of South Africa?

The improved prompt is more effective since it provides context and clarity to the question being asked.
